I am a research asistant in the department of Astronomy and Astrophysics as well as in the Institute for Gravitation and the Cosmos ([IGC](https://igc.psu.edu)). Much of my undegraduate work was focused on trying to develop a better understanding of gravity and how it might behave at a quantum scale. For the most part, I am still working on this post graduation, but have also joined the Penn State High Energy Astrophysics Detector Instrumentation ([HEADI](https://sites.psu.edu/headilab/)) Lab which is focused on detector characterization for the upcoming [BlackCAT](https://techport.nasa.gov/view/96341) (Black Hole Coded Aperture Telescope) CubeSat mission in collaboration with NASA.

My main interests for my theoretical work concern studies of compact object formation in Emergent Modified Gravity, a theory in which gravity effectively emerges from a canonical phase space. I have studied various forms of black holes and their formation mechanisms, my earliest work concerned a type of black hole in which spacetime was divided into a Lorentzian region and a Euclidean region. I am now studying models for dust collapse and a method by which massless scalar field can also form black holes. I also work on two different approaches to quantum gravity, one called CDT, in which spacetime in divided into triangles called simplexes, the other being Asymptoic Safety, which attempts to characterize what a quantum field theory of gravity should look like. You can read more about my theory work on my [Theory](/theory) page.

I currently work in the [HEADI](https://sites.psu.edu/headilab/) on the NASA BlackCAT mission, which is a wide field X-ray imaging telescope placed on a 6U CubeSat satellite to observe gamma-ray bursts and other high energy transient and flaring sources using novel X-ray hybrid CMOS detectors. My work largely revolves around the calibration and assembly of the payload that is scheduled to launch October 2025. I am also working on software to synthesize images using RML techniques to enhance the resolution of detector data. To learn more about my astronomy work, check out my [Astro](/astro) page.
